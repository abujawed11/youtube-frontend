# Build Instructions for Native Video Player

## Why Development Build is Needed

The new `NativeVideoPlayer` component uses **react-native-video**, which requires native code compilation. This provides:

- ✅ **Extremely stable** playback (no screen shaking)
- ✅ **Better buffering** with smart optimization  
- ✅ **No random seeking** or jumping
- ✅ **Native performance** 
- ✅ **Picture-in-Picture** support
- ✅ **Background audio** support
- ✅ **Adaptive streaming** 

## Setup Development Build

### 1. Install EAS CLI
```bash
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli
eas login
```

### 2. Configure Project
```bash
cd youtube-frontend
eas configure
```

### 3. Build for Development

**For Android:**
```bash
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

**For iOS (if you have Apple Developer account):**
```bash
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

### 4. Install Development Build

- Download the APK/IPA from EAS build dashboard
- Install on your device
- Run `npx expo start --dev-client` 

## Alternative: Local Development Build

### Android (Requires Android Studio):
```bash
npx expo run:android
```

### iOS (Requires Xcode on macOS):
```bash
npx expo run:ios  
```
